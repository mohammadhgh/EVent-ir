************** Applied Changes in This Revision **************
1- 3D model of Buhler Motor updated.
2- a Circlip Groove added to shafts. 
3- PG plates updated in order to make shafts' bearings fully fixed.
4- Assemble order of the system is:
	1- Place Plates No.1 and No.2 and fix them in their position.
	2- Place Buhler Motor in position and fasten bolts.
	3- Assemble Shafts and Place them in their position in on Plates No.1 and 2.
	4- Place Plate No.3 and fix it.
	5- Place Plate No.4 and fix it. (The reason behind this procedure is that we
	cannot assemble the secondary plates together because of the shafts, we must
	fix shafts in place No.3 at first and after that put plate No.4 in order to
	hold the shafts from this side)
